# Final-Year-Project
The aim of this project is to develop a GUI-based application allowing users to create simple network topologies, run IP traffic over these networks, and analyse the IP packet flow in slow motion for a better understanding of how core Internet protocols work. A desirable goal is to wrap the solution as a virtual machine instance that can be replicated for as many sessions as needed by a tutor/demonstrator.
